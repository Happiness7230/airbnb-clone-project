  <h1> Team Roles</h1>
  Business Analyst (BA)
A Business Analyst acts as a translator between the customer and the development team. They dive deep into the client's business processes to understand their needs and convert them into detailed, tangible requirements for the software developers. They ensure the final product delivers maximum business value.

Product Owner (PO)
The Product Owner is the decision-maker responsible for the product's overall vision, strategy, and success. They manage the product backlog and ensure the final product meets customer needs and market demands. While a BA focuses on the technical "how," the PO focuses on the customer-oriented "what" and "why."

Project Manager (PM)
A Project Manager ensures a product is delivered on time and within budget. They manage the development team, plan work activities, distribute tasks, and facilitate communication between stakeholders and the team to keep the project on track.

UI/UX Designer
A UI/UX Designer is responsible for the look, feel, and usability of a product.
UX (User Experience) focuses on the user's entire journey, ensuring the product is logical, efficient, and enjoyable to use.
UI (User Interface) focuses on the visual and interactive elements, creating an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing interface.

Software Architect
A Software Architect is an expert-level engineer who makes high-level technical decisions for complex projects. They design the software's overall structure, select the right tools and platforms, and set coding standards to ensure the product is secure, stable, and scalable.

Software Developer
A Software Developer is the engineer who writes the actual code to build the application.
Front-end developers build the user-facing part of the app that people interact with.
Back-end developers build the core logic, databases, and servers that power the application.
Full-stack developers can work on both the front-end and back-end.

Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer
A QA Engineer is responsible for ensuring the application works correctly and meets all requirements. They do this by performing various tests to find and report bugs, defects, and other issues related to functionality, usability, security, and performance.

Test Automation Engineer
A Test Automation Engineer writes scripts and uses tools to automate the testing process. Their goal is to create a system that can run tests automatically and continuously, which helps the team find bugs faster, improve reliability, and speed up development.

DevOps Engineer
A DevOps Engineer bridges the gap between the development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) teams. They automate the processes for building, testing, and releasing software, creating a "CI/CD pipeline" that allows for faster and more reliable product delivery while maintaining stability.
