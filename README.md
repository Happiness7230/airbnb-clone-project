<b>Docker:</b> Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.<br>
<b>CI/CD Pipelines:</b> Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.<br>

<h1>Database Design</h1>
<h2>1. API Documentation</h2>
<b>OpenAPI Standard:</b> The backend APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard to ensure clarity and ease of integration.<br>
<b>Django REST Framework:</b> Provides a comprehensive RESTful API for handling CRUD operations on user and property data.
<b>GraphQL:</b> Offers a flexible and efficient query mechanism for interacting with the backend.
<h2>2. User Authentication</h2>
Endpoints: /users/, /users/{user_id}/ <br>
Features: Register new users, authenticate, and manage user profiles.<br>
<h2>3. Property Management</h2>
<b>Endpoints:</b> /properties/, /properties/{property_id}/<br>
<b>Features:</b> Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.<br>
<h2>4. Booking System</h2
<b>Endpoints:</b> /bookings/, /bookings/{booking_id}/<br>
<b>Features:</b> Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out details.<br>
<h2>5. Payment Processing</h2>
<b>Endpoints:</b> /payments/ <br>
<b>Features:</b> Handle payment transactions related to bookings.<br>
<h2>6. Review System</h2>
<b>Endpoints:</b> /reviews/, /reviews/{review_id}/<br>
<b>Features:</b>Post and manage reviews for properties.<br>
<h2>7. Database Optimizations</h2>
<b>Indexing:</b> Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.<br>
<b>Caching:</b> Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance.<br>
<h1>Feature Breakdown</h1>
<b>User Management:</b> Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.<br>
<b>Property Management:</b> Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.<br>
<b>Booking System:</b> Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.<br>
<b>Payment Processing:</b> Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.<br>
<b>Review System:</b> Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.<br>
<b>Data Optimization:</b> Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.<br>

<h1>üîêAPI Security</h1>
<h1>. User Management</h1>
Use JWT or OAuth2 for authentication.<br>
Enforce strong password hashing (bcrypt/Argon2).<br>
Multi-factor authentication (MFA).<br>
Rate limiting for login attempts.<br>

<h1>2. Property Management</h1>
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).<br>
Validate and sanitize inputs.<br>
Restrict API responses to necessary fields only.<br>

<h1>3. Booking System</h1>
Authorization checks (users can only access their own bookings).<br>
Encrypt booking details in transit (HTTPS/TLS).<br>
Log and monitor suspicious booking activities.<br>

<h1>4. Payment Processing</h1>
Use PCI-DSS compliant payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal, etc.).<br>
Never store raw credit card data.<br>
Encrypt all transactions with HTTPS/TLS.<br>
Fraud detection and transaction monitoring.<br>

<h1>5. Review System</h1>
Only verified users can leave reviews.<br>
Sanitize inputs to prevent XSS attacks.<br>
CAPTCHA and rate limiting to prevent spam/fake reviews.<br>

<h1>6. Database & Data Security</h1>
Encrypt sensitive fields at rest (emails, payment metadata).<br>
Apply least-privilege access for database roles.<br>
Regular backups and auditing.<br>

<h1>7. API Gateway & General Security</h1>
Secure all endpoints with HTTPS/TLS.<br>
Use API keys and JWTs.<br>
Rate limiting, throttling, and DDoS protection.<br>
Centralized logging and intrusion detection.<br>

<h1>8. Asynchronous Tasks (Celery + Redis)</h1>
Sign messages to prevent tampering.<br>
Secure Redis with authentication and network restrictions.<br>
Encrypt sensitive task payloads.<br>

<h1>9. CI/CD & Deployment</h1>
Run vulnerability scans before deployment.<br>
Store secrets in environment variables (not in code).<br>
Regularly patch and update dependencies.<br>

<h1>CI/CD Pipeline</h1>
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD). It is a process that automates the building, testing, and deployment of code. CI ensures that every code change is automatically tested and integrated into the main project, while CD ensures that the tested code is automatically deployed to staging or production environments.

<h2>Why They Are Important:</h2>
üöÄ Efficiency: Automates repetitive tasks, speeding up development and deployment.<br>
üõ°Ô∏è Reliability: Ensures code changes are tested before deployment, reducing bugs in production.<br>
üîÑ Consistency: Provides a standardized process for building, testing, and deploying the application. <br>
üë• Collaboration: Makes it easier for multiple developers to contribute without breaking the project.<br>

<h2>Tools for CI/CD Pipelines:</h2>
GitHub Actions / GitLab CI ‚Äì Automates builds, testing, and deployment directly from your repo.<br>
Docker ‚Äì Ensures consistent development and production environments via containerization.<br>
Jenkins ‚Äì A powerful CI/CD server for customized workflows.<br>
CircleCI / Travis CI ‚Äì Cloud-based CI/CD services with easy integration.<br>
Kubernetes (with Helm) ‚Äì For managing containerized applications at scale.<br>
